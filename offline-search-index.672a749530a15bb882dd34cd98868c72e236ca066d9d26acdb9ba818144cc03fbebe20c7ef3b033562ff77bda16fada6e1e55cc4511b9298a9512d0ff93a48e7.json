You can use the guidelines \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo; or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project\u0026rsquo;s file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\n We use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you\u0026rsquo;re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\n Fork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you\u0026rsquo;re not yet ready for a review, add \u0026ldquo;WIP\u0026rdquo; to the PR name to indicate it\u0026rsquo;s a work in progress. (Don\u0026rsquo;t add the Hugo property \u0026ldquo;draft = true\u0026rdquo; to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it\u0026rsquo;s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of \u0026ldquo;Deploy preview ready\u0026rdquo; to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you\u0026rsquo;re happy with the content. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any \u0026ldquo;WIP\u0026rdquo; markers.  Updating a single page If you\u0026rsquo;ve just spotted something you\u0026rsquo;d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\n Click Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.  Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\n  Follow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You\u0026rsquo;ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\n  Fork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git   Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you\u0026rsquo;re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\n  Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\n  Creating an issue If you\u0026rsquo;ve found a problem in the docs, but you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo.

So I decided to write my first entry. If you want to know more, feel free to leave a comment below :) Please also write about your ideas and whether you would like to build one of these robots yourself.\nWHY Currently, due to current global situation, I have some free time to focus on fun projects. And this is a project which I had in mind for several years now. My goal is to build a small robot, which is capabale to ride stairs elegant (Not so elegant but simple solution) and simple (Not so simple but actually quite good solution and much less simple but awesome solution)\nMost solutions I found were different from what I wanted to do. But there is one video, which must be mentioned here. Because it helped me to come up with my design. (Clever design linked here)\nThe benefit of this construction is, that the balancing capabilities of the robot are available even, if the wheel is \u0026ldquo;stuck\u0026rdquo; next to a wall/staircase/etc. Due to this benefit the robot won\u0026rsquo;t be pushed away by the wall but can start to push against it and (if it has enough power) climb it (Not yet climbing things)\nAs you have seen it is the goal to climb stairs and the robot is not yet able to do it.\nBut: Utilizing only a single, simple PID controller to make the robot balance, shows - in my opinion - some potential, which is enabled by this design choice.\nWHAT I am using ROS 2.0 (Play cheering background sound here) on a Raspberry PI 3b with a Navio2 board for the orientation measurement. Two brushless gimbal motors and two quite simple brushless gimbal motor controllers to drive the robot around. And there are a lot of 3d printed parts to form the robot itself. I hope to make these parts open source soon. (Go here to find out more)\nThe current performance of the robot shows in my opinion some potential, but I feel there is first and foremost not enough power available in the drive train.\nPLANS So my plan is to update the simple unregulated brushless controllers with the ODrive board and add some encoders to have more power while not overheating the motors.\nAs soon as it can drive around safely. I would like to add some autonomous driving capabilities utilizing the lidar on top (and maybe giving the lidar some more space to better observe the environment) with the ros2 planner package. And of course I want to ride stairs (.. in matching scale)\nThats it for now :) Feel free to comment below and ..\nTHANKS FOR READING!\nEnjoy making fun stuff with ros!\n","excerpt":"Originally published on discourse.ros.org\nThere was some encouragement to post about my balancing …","ref":"/blog/2020/07/08/videte-wheel-to-climb-stairs/","title":"Videte Wheel to climb Stairs"},{"body":"Self Balancing Robot Version 2.0 available on Github Find release 2.0 here: https://github.com/Printed-Robots/balancing_robot/releases/tag/2.0\n","excerpt":"Self Balancing Robot Version 2.0 available on Github Find release 2.0 here: …","ref":"/blog/2020/06/10/self-balancing-robot-version-2.0/","title":"Self Balancing Robot Version 2.0"},{"body":"Self Balancing Robot Version 1.0 available on Github Find release 1.0 here: https://github.com/Printed-Robots/balancing_robot/releases/tag/1.0\n","excerpt":"Self Balancing Robot Version 1.0 available on Github Find release 1.0 here: …","ref":"/blog/2020/06/09/self-balancing-robot-version-1.0/","title":"Self Balancing Robot Version 1.0"},{"body":"Watch me build a Hubless Inverted Pendulum Wheel!

Details For the technical enthusiast This is a ROS 2.0 based robot using a Raspberry Pi 3b with a Navio2 Sensor board. To balance the robot there are two PID controllers in use - one for velocity and one for the angle. While I can measeure the angle, I currently have no sensor to measure the velocity. This makes it hard for the robot to stand on uneven ground. But fear not: Sensors are on their way :)\nFor the hardware fan The structural parts are 3d printed. To move the robot there are two brushless gimbal motors, which are awesomly quiet! And .. there is a small fan to cool the robot ;)\nFor the open source lover The code used to make this robot balance can be found here\n https://github.com/jsqu4re/balance_robot https://github.com/jsqu4re/balance_robot_msgs https://github.com/jsqu4re/n2r2  ","excerpt":"Watch it explore the world!
